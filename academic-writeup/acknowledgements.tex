\section{Acknowledgments}

PolyPasswordHasher benefitted tremendously from feedback and assistance by many 
outside parties.   Foremost is Santiago Torres, who produced a C 
implementation based upon the specification.   Lisa Hellerstein and Dennis
Shasha provided excellent feedback on the core ideas at an early stage.   
We are indebted to Justin Quick, Mike Amling, Peter Maxwell, Christopher 
Taylor, Gregory Maxwell, Jim Manico, Justin Samuel, John Hoffman, 
Andy Lutomirski, as well as participants in the Password Hashing 
Competition for their excellent feedback, advice, and suggestions.
