\section{Implementation}
\label{sec-implementation}


Our reference implementation for PolyPasswordHasher is available with an MIT license 
at \showurlx.  It utilizes
a 16 byte salt, with SHA256 to compute password hashes.   The Shamir
Secret Sharing routines
utilize GF256 as the underlying field (encoding each byte as a separate
share).   %The implementation of Shamir Secret Sharing was written while
%referencing the open source Python {\tt tss} implementation, but was 
%essentially rewritten to handle the interfaces needed by PolyPasswordHasher.   
The full code base for PolyPasswordHasher is 203 lines of Python code and
223 lines of C code\footnote{
All line of code counts are according to SLOCcount~\cite{wheeler-sloccount}}.   
PolyPasswordHasher uses Python's standard hashlib for SHA256 and the PyCrypto
implementation of AES.
The GF256 operations, Lagrange interpolation, and polynomial math code
are written in C for performance reasons.   All other code is written in 
Python.  The main code for PolyPasswordHasher, which handles account
creation, accessing a persisted store, writing a store to disk,
checking passwords, and similar operations, is 87 lines of Python code.
Adding support for thresholdless accounts involved adding 20 lines of Python
code.   Partial verification added 13 lines of Python code.
The remaining Python is wrapper code for the C-based 
Shamir Secret Sharing implementation.
